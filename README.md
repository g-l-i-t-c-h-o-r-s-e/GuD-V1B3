# OHAI
This tool is useful for making memes, or in my case, turning still images into a great source for datamoshing.


# Requirements
Get FFmpeg & FFplay from: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.zip                          
Get ImageMagick from somwhere like:                                                                   
ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/binaries/ImageMagick-7.0.9-8-portable-Q16-x86.zip

For now, you need to set the first few variables in the script to point at the folder that contains FFmpeg, FFplay and convert.          
Specifically:
```
IM :=
FFmpeg :=
FFplay :=
```
